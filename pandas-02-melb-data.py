# Now, lets build the model
'''
We will use Scikit-learn library to create our model. This library is written as sklearn in our code
It is easily the most popular library for modeling the types of data typically stores in DataFrames

STEPS IN BUILDING & USING A MODEL
1. Define:
    - model type (Ex: DT or other type)
    - model params
2. Fit:
    Capture patterns from provided data (This is the heart of modelling)
3. Predict:
    Crystal clear
4. Evaluate:
    Measure the accuracy of your model
